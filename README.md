# Release-1 Report

## Project Overview  
**Code Mood** is a fun, developer-first VS Code extension that aims to detect a developer’s emotional state based on their code and responds with themes, fonts, music, and humor tailored to that mood. It blends productivity tools with entertaining, mood-driven dynamics to make coding more expressive and engaging.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Mood Detection Based on Code  
Analyzes code structures, error patterns, comments, and complexity to determine the coder’s current mood.  

### 2. Mood-Aligned Fonts  
Fonts dynamically update to reflect the detected mood. For example:
- Comic Sans for chaotic/frustrated coding.  
- Consolas for calm focus.  

### 3. Mood-Aligned Themes  
Color themes adjust in real time. For example:
- Dark+  for frustration.  
- Monokai for a focused mood.  
- Solarized for an anxious mood.  

### 4. Code Smell Detection  
Identifies poor coding practices such as:
- Long methods  
- Methods with too many parameters  
- Deeply nested blocks  
- Large classes  
- Duplicated codes  

### 5. Sarcastic Comments on Code Smells  
Sarcastic ghost-style comments are injected for each smell.  

Examples:
- `"# Because having 200 lines in one function is totally maintainable."`  
- `"# That unused variable? It's just here for emotional support."`

### 6. Corresponding Mood-Based Music  
Auto-plays background music (audio-only) depending on the mood of the developer.  

Some of the playlists include:
- Chill Lo-fi  
- Angry metal riffs  
- Dramatic movie soundtrack.  

### 7. Per-File Timer Tracking  
Each file opened in the editor is tracked for time spent.  

Helps identify coding hotspots or zones of procrastination.

### 8. Analytics & Flow Chart  
Timer data is visualized via:
- Coding activity graphs  
- Time-distribution per file  
- Focus streak detection

## Methodology & Techniques Used

- The extension integrates **Mistral-7B-Instruct** via **Hugging Face’s Inference API** to analyze code for emotional cues. A tailored system prompt drives the model to infer developer mood from coding style. Lightweight, high-performance architecture ensures fast predictions. Periodic re-evaluation updates the mood, triggering dynamic changes in VS Code themes and fonts.

- For code smell detection, it employs **AST-based static analysis** using Python’s built-in `ast` module. A custom `CodeSmellDetector` class extends `ast.NodeVisitor`, overriding key visit methods to inspect definitions and control flow for known smells.

- Humorous feedback is generated by sending code smells to **Mistral-7B-Instruct** with a sarcasm prompt. The response is mapped to line numbers and displayed via ghost-style inline decorations using the **Diagnostics API**. Hover support adds context, and asynchronous execution keeps the editor responsive.

- The extension uses editor listeners like `onDidOpenTextDocument` and `onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` to track per-file coding time. Timestamps are stored in `startTime` and `totalTime` maps. On command, durations are computed and formatted into a **Chart.js pie chart** inside a `WebviewPanel`. Metrics like **productivity score** and **mood inference** are derived from this time data.

- To play music based on mood, a `WebviewPanel` is created with UI controls. When a command is received via `onDidReceiveMessage`, the extension spawns a VS Code terminal, runs a shell command that uses **yt-dlp** to extract audio and pipes it into **ffplay**. This enables real-time, online music playback.

## Technologies Used

- **Visual Studio Code API** – Used to build the extension’s UI and logic through commands, decorations, diagnostics, and terminal integration.  
- **JavaScript (Node.js)** – Core language for implementing features with modular CommonJS structure.  
- **Chart.js** – Integrated into webviews for visualizing time data using interactive pie charts.  
- **yt-dlp + ffplay** – Terminal-based tools used for extracting and streaming music audio based on mood.  
- **VS Code Webview API** – Powers the custom music panel and time chart interface within the editor.  
- **Hugging Face Inference API** – Utilized for detecting developer mood through lightweight sentiment analysis.  
- **Diagnostics & Decoration API** – Used to highlight code smells and add inline ghost comments with a sarcastic tone in Python files.
